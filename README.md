# Inception Project

The Inception project was an incredibly enriching experience for me, and I've decided to document my journey through it in the form of a comprehensive guide.  

The guide begins with the utilization of official Docker images sourced directly from Docker Hub. This initial step is crucial in gaining a fundamental understanding of how the system operates.  

Following this, I delve into the process of setting up each container manually. This involves creating custom Docker images based on Alpine Linux, a lightweight and security-oriented distribution. This hands-on approach provides a deeper insight into the inner workings of the system.  

I invite you to follow along with the guide at the following link:

I strongly recommend undertaking each step individually. This segmented approach will allow for a more thorough comprehension of the setup process.
