# Inception

I liked this project immensely, so I have created a guide while doing it.  
In the guide I start by using the official docker images from the docker hub to better understand how does it work.  
I am then setting up each container manually (creating custom docker image) based on Alpine Linux.  
Feel free to follow the guide here:

I suggest to do each step separately to better understand the settup.
